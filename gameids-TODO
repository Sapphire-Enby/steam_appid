1. make a list of only the files ending in .acf in these two Directories
2.(make sure that the entries in the list are full filepaths)
3. pass each file path into a acf_handler function:
 
> [ x ] afc_handler

>Sanity Test: Move on to next acf file if fail
  - has a line that contains "name" 
  - AND a line that contains "appid"

> on Pass:
  - give game name and appid values to whatevers managing the list (consider sending the path as well)

> List handlerer:
  - a global dictorary with appids as keys and values being name and filepath 
  - need to figure out a way to send a game name and have it return the id,
  - -`key = next((k for k, v in my_dict.items() if v == value_to_find), None)`
